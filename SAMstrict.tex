\noindent
This document is a companion to the {\sl Sequence Alignment/Map Format
Specification} that defines the SAM file format.\footnote{See
\href{http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf}{\tt SAMv1.pdf} at \url{https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs}.}
The SAM file format defines the syntax required for a file to be
a valid SAM file. It does not require such files to be semantically
valid and internally consistent.
This document describes a set of additional semantic restrictions
for which the subset of syntactically valid SAM files that comply
with these restrictions can be described as \textit{SAM strict
compliant}.

\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Introduction}
\begin{abstract}

The SAM specifications have been instrumental in standardising
the file formats used for sequence alignment. A large ecosystem of
bioinformatics tools is now capable of reading and/or writing
SAM files. Unfortunately, many tools that read SAM files are tightly
coupled to a particular upstream tool 
and fail to correctly execute on valid SAM files written by other
tools. In part, this is due to the lack of semantic restrictions
inherent in the SAM file format. A syntactically valid SAM file
can be both internally inconsistent and semantically nonsensical.

The purpose of this document is to provide a baseline of semantic
validity for which tools should comply with when outputing SAM
files, and tools which input SAM files can safely assume when
they require input files to be \textit{SAM strict compliant}.

\section{General}

\subsection{Mate alignments}

\section{SAM Tags}

\subsection{Standard Tags}

\paragraph{}

No record can include any reserved tags not defined in the
{\sl Sequence Alignment/Map Optional Fields Specification}.
Non-standard tags must start X, Y, Z or a lowercase letter as per the SAM specifications.

\paragraph{}

The \textit{type} of all \textit{standard tags} must match the type
defined in the {\sl Sequence Alignment/Map Optional Fields Specification}.

\subsection{SA}

For the purpose of this section, a \textit{SA record set} is a set of SAM records
from a single \textit{read} which collectively represent a single \textit{chimeric alignment}.

\paragraph{}

All records referenced in the SA tag of a given record must have a SA tag defined.

\paragraph{}

All records referenced in the SA tag of a given record must include the given
record in their SA tag.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} with a FI tag defined must have the same FI tag value.

\paragraph{}

All records referenced in the SA tag must exist with matching \textit{rname, pos, strand, CIGAR}.

\paragraph{}

The SA \textit{mapq} of all references to a given record in a \textit{SA record set} must
match the record mapping quality.

\paragraph{}

The SA \textit{NM} of all references to a given record in a \textit{SA record set} must
match the record \textit{NM} tag value.

\paragraph{}

All records except 1 in a \textit{SA record set} must have the supplementary flag set.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} must have the same 0x100 (secondary alignment) FLAG bit.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} must have FLAG bit 0x4 (segment unmapped) not set.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} must have the same RNEXT.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} must have the same PNEXT.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} must have CIGARs with matching read length. That is,
chimeric alignment records must include either soft clipping or hard clipping CIGAR operations
for read bases which were not aligned.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} with SEQ not equal to * must have a SEQ consistent
with all other records in the \textit{SA record set}. That is, chimeric alignments that define
a segment sequence must be consistent with all other records defining a segment sequence. For
example, 10th base in a read cannot be be A in one chimeric alignment, but T in another.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} with QUAL not equal to * must have a SEQ consistent
with all other records in the \textit{SA record set}.

\paragraph{}

All records in a \textit{SA record set} must align at least one read base that does not
overlap with any other alignments in the \textit{SA record set}.
That is, a chimeric alignment cannot contain superfluous alignment records.
